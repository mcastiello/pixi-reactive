# pixi-reactive
> The `PixiReactive` library is a quick way to use all the features provided by [PIXI](http://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html)
> inside a [React](https://reactjs.org/) virtual DOM. The ultimate goal is to encapsulate all the PIXI elements inside React Function Components that can be easily added to your project. As a matter of fact, in most use cases, you may never need to instantiate a PIXI object yourself. You won't need to load a renderer or worry about the animation loop, and the page resize. You just need to add a `PixiCanvas` to your component and start coding your game or animation.
>
> You will also be able to mix HTML content with PIXI objects... I mean, you may never need it, but it's there...

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pixi-reactive.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixi-reactive) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install
This library uses both `React` and `PIXI` as peer dependencies, which basically means that they are required, but they are not automatically imported, so that you can use your own versions and you won't have duplicates among your node modules. So, depending on your favourite package manager, you will need to install all the 3 libraries as follows:
```bash
npm install react pixi.js pixi-reactive
```
or
```bash
yarn add react pixi.js pixi-reactive
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';
import { PixiCanvas, PixiTilingSprite, PixiSprite } from 'pixi-reactive';

/**
 * List of textures. It supports image assets or JSON files created with TexturePacker
 */
const textures = {
  galaxy: './static/assets/galaxy.png',
  stars: './static/assets/slow-stars.png',
  ship: './static/assets/spaceship.png'
};

type Space = {
  galaxyTileX: number;
  starsTileX: number;
  direction: boolean;
  shipY: number;
};

/**
 * Update all the properties that will affect the scene using a React reducer.
 * @param {Space} state
 * @returns {Space}
 */
const updateScene = (state: Space): Space => {
  let newDirection = state.direction;

  if ((state.direction && state.shipY <= 60) || (!state.direction && state.shipY >= 240)) {
    newDirection = !state.direction;
  }
  return {
    galaxyTileX: state.galaxyTileX - 0.1,
    starsTileX: state.starsTileX - 0.5,
    direction: newDirection,
    shipY: newDirection ? state.shipY - 0.5 : state.shipY + 0.5
  };
};

const PixiCanvasExample: React.FC = () => {
  // Generate the scene state and the update function
  const [state, update] = useReducer(updateScene, {
    galaxyTileX: 0,
    starsTileX: 0,
    direction: false,
    shipY: 150
  });

  return (
    <PixiCanvas textures={textures} onUpdate={update}>
      <PixiTilingSprite texture={'galaxy'} tileX={state.galaxyTileX} />
      <PixiTilingSprite texture={'stars'} tileX={state.starsTileX} />
      <PixiSprite texture={'ship'} x={30} y={state.shipY} anchorY={0.5} />
    </PixiCanvas>
  );
};
```

## Coming Next
The following are a few things I'm going to add in the next few releases (in order of priority).
- `PixiSpine` - Another external plugin, this one is going to integrate support for the [Spine Runtime](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-spine).
